This project is the first official project I set out to create from scratch. It was also the second project I did while attending UIT. 

I coded this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I used bootstrap for styling. 

The main features of the project is that it is a chat app made for gamers. Users would login using Github or Facebook (Using firebase to store user data).

There would be a number of chatting channels / rooms all named after a certain video game. Each room would consist of discussions of said video game. 

On the right sidebar there is a news section where users can see if there are any updates for their favourite games or if there has been a new release of a game. The news section does not use an API it is just hardcoded because it was my first major project.

Many comments in the code from the tutorial I was following. Although I did do some commenting myself.
